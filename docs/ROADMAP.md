# Goal App - Roadmap (Shipping Track)

## Phase A - Onboarding polish (today)
- [x] Sticky CTA inside card on all steps
- [x] Store-backed state (Zustand)
- [x] Micro-step generator reacts to energy + feeling
- [x] Copy: energy rationale + first-rep-is-tiny note
- [ ] Playwright: CTA bounds, energy reflects summary

## Phase B - Daily Loop (MVP complete)
- [ ] Today Card: Do / Log / Skip
- [ ] Friction Triage: too_hard | bad_timing | low_energy | forgot
- [ ] Adaptation: apply tweak from provider (mock first)
- [ ] Integration Check: mark auto if "felt automatic" 4/7 days

## Phase C - Insights
- [ ] Weekly Recap: slope + donut
- [ ] Tweak acceptance UI (one tap)
- [ ] Export CSV/JSON (goal, step, outcome, reason, energy, notes)

## Phase D - Platforms
- [ ] PWA install prompt
- [ ] Push subscribe + single test notification
- [ ] Offline queue e2e test (airplane mode)

## Philosophy (never compromise)
- First reps stay ≤2 min regardless of energy budget
- Step up 10-15% only at ≥70% success (14-day window)
- Promote to baseline at ≥80% auto; spawn new discovery seed
- Integration > heroics. Whisper "again tomorrow," never yell "be epic."
